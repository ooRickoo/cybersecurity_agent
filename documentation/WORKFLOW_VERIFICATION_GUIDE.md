# Workflow Verification System Guide

This guide covers the comprehensive "Check our math" verification system integrated with the Cybersecurity Agent. This system provides intelligent workflow verification, accuracy assessment, and automatic backtracking to prevent loops and improve results.

## üîç Overview

The Workflow Verification System is designed to:

- **Verify Accuracy**: Compare questions, steps taken, and final outputs
- **Prevent Loops**: Track execution paths to avoid repeating failed approaches
- **Enable Backtracking**: Automatically select alternative workflow templates when verification fails
- **Improve Quality**: Provide detailed analysis and recommendations for workflow improvement

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Workflow Verification System** (`workflow_verification_system.py`)
   - Main verification engine
   - Accuracy scoring and analysis
   - Loop detection and prevention

2. **Workflow Template Manager** (`workflow_template_manager.py`)
   - Template selection and management
   - Backtracking decision handling
   - Alternative approach generation

3. **MCP Tools** (`workflow_verification_mcp_tools.py`)
   - NLP-friendly interfaces for agents
   - Comprehensive verification workflows
   - User-friendly output generation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Basic Verification Workflow

```python
# 1. Execute your workflow and collect step information
workflow_steps = [
    {
        "step_id": "step1",
        "step_type": "data_collection",
        "description": "Gather threat intelligence data",
        "inputs": {"source": "threat_feeds"},
        "outputs": {"threat_data": "malware_indicators"},
        "tools_used": ["threat_intel_tool"],
        "execution_time": 2.5,
        "status": "completed"
    },
    # ... more steps
]

# 2. Call the verification system
verification_result = check_our_math(
    execution_id="exec_001",
    original_question="What is the current threat landscape?",
    workflow_steps=workflow_steps,
    final_answer="Based on analysis, we've identified...",
    question_type="threat_analysis"
)
```

### Automatic Backtracking

```python
# If verification fails, handle backtracking automatically
if verification_result["verification_result"]["needs_backtrack"]:
    backtrack_result = handle_verification_failure(
        execution_id="exec_001",
        verification_result=verification_result["verification_result"],
        original_question="What is the current threat landscape?"
    )
    
    # Execute alternative workflow
    if backtrack_result["success"]:
        print(f"Using alternative template: {backtrack_result['template_name']}")
        # Execute the new workflow template
```

## üìä Verification Process

### 1. Question-Answer Alignment Check

The system analyzes how well the final answer addresses the original question:

- **Keyword Matching**: Identifies key terms from the question in the answer
- **Completeness Assessment**: Checks if the answer covers all aspects of the question
- **Relevance Scoring**: Measures the relevance of the answer to the question

### 2. Workflow Completeness Check

Evaluates whether the workflow steps are appropriate for the question type:

- **Expected Patterns**: Checks for required step types (e.g., analysis, assessment, conclusion)
- **Step Coverage**: Ensures all necessary phases are included
- **Complexity Matching**: Aligns workflow complexity with question complexity

### 3. Evidence Quality Check

Assesses the quality of evidence supporting the conclusions:

- **Data Sources**: Identifies tools and data sources used
- **Output Quality**: Evaluates the richness of step outputs
- **Specificity**: Checks for concrete data points and metrics

### 4. Logical Consistency Check

Verifies the logical flow of the workflow:

- **Step Sequence**: Ensures logical progression (e.g., data collection before analysis)
- **Reasoning Chain**: Checks for logical indicators in the final answer
- **Assumption Validation**: Identifies potential logical gaps

### 5. Tool Usage Appropriateness Check

Evaluates whether the right tools were used for the question:

- **Tool Selection**: Checks if tools match the question type
- **Tool Diversity**: Ensures appropriate variety of tools
- **Effectiveness**: Assesses tool usage patterns

## üéØ Accuracy Scoring

### Scoring Components

Each verification check contributes to the overall accuracy score:

- **Question-Answer Alignment**: 20% weight
- **Workflow Completeness**: 20% weight
- **Evidence Quality**: 20% weight
- **Logical Consistency**: 20% weight
- **Tool Usage Appropriateness**: 20% weight

### Confidence Levels

Based on accuracy scores:

- **High Confidence** (‚â•0.8): Workflow passed verification
- **Medium Confidence** (0.6-0.79): Workflow needs review
- **Low Confidence** (<0.6): Workflow failed, backtracking required

### Question Type Thresholds

Different question types have different accuracy thresholds:

- **Threat Analysis**: High threshold (0.8) due to critical nature
- **Incident Response**: High threshold (0.85) for operational accuracy
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Very high threshold (0.9) for security
- **Compliance Audit**: Very high threshold (0.9) for regulatory requirements
- **General Investigation**: Standard threshold (0.8)

## üîÑ Backtracking System

### When Backtracking is Triggered

Backtracking is automatically triggered when:

- **Accuracy Score < 0.6**: Workflow significantly underperforms
- **Multiple Issues**: More than 2 critical issues identified
- **Loop Detection**: Same execution path used multiple times
- **Verification Errors**: System errors prevent proper verification

### Backtracking Process

1. **Failure Analysis**: Analyze why the original approach failed
2. **Template Selection**: Choose alternative workflow template
3. **Confidence Assessment**: Calculate confidence in the alternative
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Provide specific next steps

### Alternative Template Selection

The system intelligently selects alternatives based on:

- **Failure Patterns**: Addresses specific failure reasons
- **Template Success Rates**: Prefers proven approaches
- **Complexity Matching**: Aligns with question requirements
- **Tool Availability**: Ensures required capabilities exist

## üõ§Ô∏è Loop Prevention

### Path Tracking

The system tracks execution paths to prevent loops:

- **Path Hashing**: Creates unique identifiers for execution sequences
- **Usage Counting**: Monitors how often each path is used
- **Threshold Detection**: Triggers alerts when paths are overused

### Loop Detection

Loops are detected when:

- **Same Path Used**: Identical step sequence executed multiple times
- **Threshold Exceeded**: Path used more than 3 times
- **No Improvement**: Repeated attempts don't improve accuracy

### Alternative Path Generation

When loops are detected, the system suggests:

- **Step Reordering**: Change the sequence of workflow steps
- **Step Combination**: Merge related steps for efficiency
- **Step Splitting**: Break complex steps into simpler ones
- **Tool Variation**: Use different tools for the same purpose
