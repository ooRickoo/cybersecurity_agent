## üìã Best Practices

### 1. Connection Management

- **Reuse Connections**: Don't create new connections for each operation
- **Monitor Status**: Regularly check connection health
- **Clean Disconnect**: Always disconnect when finished
- **Resource Limits**: Be mindful of connection pool limits

### 2. Query Optimization

- **Use Limits**: Always limit large result sets
- **Specific Fields**: Select only needed columns
- **Index Awareness**: Understand table indexing for performance
- **Batch Operations**: Group related queries together

### 3. Security Considerations

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use minimal required permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Log all operations with business reasons
- **Data Classification**: Be aware of data sensitivity levels
- **Compliance Requirements**: Follow organizational data handling policies

### 4. Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle connection failures gracefully
- **Retry Logic**: Implement appropriate retry mechanisms
- **Fallback Options**: Have alternative data sources when possible
- **User Communication**: Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Failures

```python
# Check connection status
get_connection_status(connection_id="your_connection_id")

# List all connections
list_database_connections()
list_ad_connections()
```

#### Schema Discovery Issues

```python
# Force schema refresh
discover_database_schema(
    connection_id="your_connection_id",
    reason="Refreshing schema after database changes"
)
```

#### Performance Issues

```python
# Limit result sets
query_database(
    connection_id="your_connection_id",
    query="SELECT * FROM large_table",
    limit=100,  # Reduce from default 1000
    reason="Performance testing with limited results"
)
```

### Debug Information

    "failed_attempts": "SELECT * FROM auth_logs WHERE status = 'failed'"
}
```

### Batch Operations

```python
# Execute multiple related queries
batch_queries = [
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM groups", 
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM computers"
]

for query in batch_queries:
    result = query_database(connection_id, query)
    # Process results
```

### Automated Analysis

```python
# Automated security assessment
def security_assessment(connection_id):
    # Get all users
    users = get_all_ad_users(connection_id)
    
    # Analyze each user
    for user in users:
        permissions = analyze_ad_user_permissions(connection_id, user.sam_account_name)
        # Process security findings
    
    # Export results
    export_ad_users_to_csv(connection_id)
```
